## Environment

```bash
cd /path/to/smartresizeimage
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r backend/requirements-ci.txt
.venv/bin/pip install "uvicorn[standard]" playwright   # server + browser checks
sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr                   # optional OCR (else not_checked)
export OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1                               # keeps tesseract from oversubscribing
```

## Verify

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check backend
.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests -q
.venv/bin/python backend/tools/generate_bench_fixtures.py --cases 12 --seed 42
.venv/bin/python backend/tools/run_layout_bench.py --mode design --seed 42 --outdir /tmp/bench_design
.venv/bin/python backend/tools/run_layout_bench.py --mode both   --seed 42 --outdir /tmp/bench_both
```

## Run the product

```bash
AUTOBANNER_DATA_DIR=./data .venv/bin/uvicorn backend.app.api.server:app --port 8000
# open http://localhost:8000  (API docs at /api/docs)
```

## Browser journey check

The Playwright script used for verification lives outside the repo during the session
(`scratchpad/ui_journey.py`); its steps: create blank canvas → add text (prompt) → add logo
(file input) → add elements via API → mark price verbatim → drag/nudge/undo → add rule →
brief with custom size + copy override → generate → review → approve / reject with reason →
per-variant override regenerate → export approved zip → save project zip → reopen via import
→ learned-rules panel shows the approved variant → 900px viewport without horizontal scroll
→ no console errors. Re-create it from this list if
needed; launch Chromium with `executable_path="/opt/pw-browsers/chromium"` in this environment.

## Next executable task

H5 — retrieval from correction history: rejection reasons already land in the event log
(`api/events.py`, kind `approval` with `reason`) and every variant keeps its plan. Add
`backend/app/design/corrections.py` that, per project, pairs a rejected variant with the
next accepted variant of the same size and derives a reviewable rule from the difference
(e.g. reason mentions "logo" and the logo's scale grew → `scale_range` proposal on the logo;
reason mentions "text"/"read" and a plate or larger font followed → `min_text_size`
proposal), stored with provenance `recovered` and confidence 0.5. Expose them next to the
learned families (`GET /api/projects/{id}/learned` → `corrections`), let the planner apply
confirmed ones as constraints, and add a regression test where a rejected "logo too small"
variant makes the next generation keep the logo above the accepted scale. Then measure on
the synthetic corpus whether repeat rejections for the same reason drop (record in
`EXPERIMENTS.md`, H5). After that: roles within an owner, retention, rate limiting.

## Files to know

- `backend/app/quality/` — contract v2 (checks, verdict rules)
- `backend/app/design/` — document, serialize, fonts, text_render, adapter, assets, project,
  render, variant (incl. H3 reference plans), planner, examples (H1), decompose
- `backend/app/api/` — service (domain ops), server (FastAPI), jobs, presets
- `backend/app/web/` — index.html, app.js, styles.css
- `backend/tools/run_layout_bench.py` — modes baseline/phase21/phase3/design
- `docs/mission/` — this workspace; `evidence/` holds the preserved false positive
